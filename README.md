# Advent of Code 2024
### https://adventofcode.com/2024  
Welcome to my attempt at the 2024 Advent of Code challenge.  
I started a few days late this year so my solutions might be a bit behind unless I can catch up.  
I have used Python but I have not tried to write crazy-short concise one liner solutions. I have gone for a readable and hopefully easy to understand approach with plenty of comments and useful named variables.  
My solutions aren't neccessarily the fastest or best way of solving each problem, but I hope they are logical and sensible!
